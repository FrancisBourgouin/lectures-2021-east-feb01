# Data Fetching & Other Side Effects

## Today's menu

- Recap on hooks (useState, rules)
- Fetching information from an api
- Immutable data patterns with Objects and Arrays
- The useEffect hook!

## Recap - Rules of Hooks

- Only call Hooks from the top-level of a function component or a custom Hook.

  - Cannot be called in React class components, loops, if statement, regular function, in event handlers

- A custom Hook must start with the keyword "use"

  - a custom Hook can call other custom or built-in Hooks.

```js

// allowed?
const TweetList = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  if (user) {
    useEffect(() => {
      axios.get('/api/tweets/')
      .then(res => console.log(res.data))
    }, [])
  }

  //the is a "hidden" return
}

// allowed?
class Tweet extends React.component {

  render(){
    const [tweets, setTweets] = useState([])

    return(
      <div><h1>Tweets</h1>
    )
  }
}

// allowed?
const useData = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)
}

// allowed?
const getTodo = (id) => {
  const [todo, setTodo] = useState([]);
}

```

## Custom Hooks

- React is usually coupling the UI to a component
- Sometimes we just want to use some code logic without tying it to a particular UI
- Custom Hooks allow us to do that

Example of custom hook

- [Custom Hook - Browser Dimensions](https://codesandbox.io/s/custom-hooks-exercise-browser-dimensions-j80xw)

In the example where we used `useEffect` to perform a request to Github and pull out the contributors to the Tweeter repo, the request is actually tied to the component itself. What about is we want to reuse the request?

## Immutable Data Patterns with Arrays and Objects

Immutability is an important concept of `Functional Programming`.

From Wikipedia

> In computing, a persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure.

In other words...

- Don’t mutate data, and if you have to – create a clone and mutate it.
- Reuse unchanged parts. Only changed parts should be changed.

### Benefits of immutability

- Immutable data structure are simpler to construct, test, and use
- Truly immutable values are always thread-safe
- Immutable data is side-effect free (avoids unexpected bugs hard to detect)
- You can quicky compare the previous and the new version

Some libraries enforce immutability

- [immutable js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/)
- [mori](https://swannodette.github.io/mori/)
- [Rambda js](https://ramdajs.com/)

### Arrays

- An array is not immutable in JavaScript
- we need to use only the pure array methods and the spread operator
- The pure array methods are the ones that create a new array when something changes

  - pop(), push() and splice() are not pure
  - concat(), slice() are pure

### Objects

## What are Side Effects

Think of it as, when an action occurs, a reaction will happen. Very simularly, in react context, when a component mounts, something sort of action can potentialy be fired ( which in our case is controlled by the useEffect). In short, React encapsulates side effects with useEffect.

setting up useEffect like this will fire the app any time its re-rendered ( whenever theres a state change)

useEffect( () => {
  console.log("welcome")
})
setting up useEffect like this will make the app only ONCE ( only on first render)

useEffect( () => {
  console.log("ONLY ONCE")
}, [] )// notice the empty array
setting up useEffect like this make the app render only when the state siren changes

useEffect( () => {
  console.log("woop woop")
}, [siren] )// notice the array now has one value which is a state
PITFALL
The fact that the effect re-execute after each render might cause an infinite loop. This can be done like this

useEffect( () => {
  console.log("TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!!")
  setValue(12) // setValue alters the value state
}, [ value ] )// value is a state
infinity

useEffect runs initial when the state gets set, then useEffect sets the state, which then runs useEffect which then runs useEffect which then sets the state...... ( etc etc etc ). Make sure to avoid this as this is very bad. We never want infinite loops.
